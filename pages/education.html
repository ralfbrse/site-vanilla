            <p>I graduated with my bachelor's of science in computer science in December 2023. It took me 4 and a half
                years, with classes every summer because I took a break semester to try and pursue nursing. After that
                semester, I changed my major from my original computer engineering major to computer science. I did all
                of this while working part time in order to pay for parking, books, tech, and other daily expenses.
